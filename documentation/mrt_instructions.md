# MRT Instructions (3/3)

We will now be asking you to complete a number of these exercises under a 10 minute time limit. The timer at the top of the page will indicate how much time you have left. At the end of 10 minutes, the test will automatically save your responses and end the test. 

Please complete the test as quickly and accurately as you can. Refrain from guessing the answers to questions. Remember that each question has exactly 2 models which are considered correct.
