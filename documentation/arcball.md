As shown above, in the Arcball Controller the model is centered within a 3D sphere. To rotate the object, you hold down the left mouse button and mouse the mouse along the surface of the sphere. The object will move as if you have push the object along the direction you're moving the mouse. When rotating, the sphere will become more opaque. For example,

- <span class="instruction">LMB ![Left Mouse Button](images/LMB_click.png) + moving up along the sphere</span>: model will rotate upwards
- <span class="instruction">LMB ![Left Mouse Button](images/LMB_click.png) + moving left along the sphere</span>: model will rotate leftwards
- <span class="instruction">LMB ![Left Mouse Button](images/LMB_click.png) + moving diagonally along the sphere</span>: model will move diagonally according to the direction you trace out with the mouse
- <span class="instruction">LMB ![Left Mouse Button](images/LMB_click.png) + moving clockwise/anti-clockwise along the edge of the sphere</span>: model will move clockwise/anti-clockwise
