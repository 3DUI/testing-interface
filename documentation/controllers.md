# Introduction to rotation controllers

In this experiment, you will be using three different rotation controllers. A _rotation controller_ is a user interface element which allows you to rotate a shape called a _model_. For all the controllers, you rotate a model by pressing and holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse. The model will be rotated as soon as you start moving the mouse.

In the instructions, when you see"<span class="instruction">LMB ![Left Mouse Button](images/LMB_click.png)</span>", that means pressing and holding the left mouse button. Whatever follows this is an instruction about the type of mouse movement for that type of rotation. After you complete that motion, you should lift the mouse button. So, for example

<span class="instruction">LMB ![Left Mouse Button](images/LMB_click.png) + Moving up </span>

means holding down the left mouse button while moving the mouse towards the top of the screen, then releasing the left mouse button.

When your mouse is over certain places or you are undertaking certain actions, it will change. Here are what the different cursors mean:

- ![Grab](https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/3440/=grab.gif): you can rotate the model in a number of different directions.
- ![Pointer](https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/3449/=pointer.gif): you can rotate in one direction
- ![Grabbing](https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/3441/=grabbing.gif): you are currently rotating the model.
