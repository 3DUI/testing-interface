As shown above, in the Two Axis Valuator Controller the model is centered within a yellow circle. To rotate the model, hold down the left mouse button down and move the mouse. If you do this, the yellow circle will turn white.

How the model rotates depends on whether you are moving the mouse inside or outside the circle:

## Inside the circle
<span class="instruction">LMB ![Left Mouse Button](images/LMB_click.png) + Moving inside the circle</span>: the model will rotate in cardinal directions according to your mouse.

- <span class="instruction">LMB ![Left Mouse Button](images/LMB_click.png) + left/right inside the circle</span>: model will rotate left/right
- <span class="instruction">LMB ![Left Mouse Button](images/LMB_click.png) + up/down inside the circle</span>: model will rotate up/down

You can also combine motions: if you hold the mouse down, and move it (within the circle) first left, then up then diagonally then the model will rotate left, right and diagonally along with your motions. 

## Outside the circle
<span class="instruction">LMB ![Left Mouse Button](images/LMB_click.png) + Moving outside the circle</span>: the model will rotate clockwise or anticlockwise depending on what direction you move your mouse.

- <span class="instruction">LMB ![Left Mouse Button](images/LMB_click.png) + clockwise outside the circle</span>: model will rotate clockwise
- <span class="instruction">LMB ![Left Mouse Button](images/LMB_click.png) + anti-clockwise outside the circle</span>: model will rotate anti-clockwise
