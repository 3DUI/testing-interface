# Evaluation Documentation

In this evaluation, you will be evaluating three different three dimensional user interfaces (3DUIs). These UIs are called "rotation controllers" as they allow you to rotate three dimensional shapes. You will be doing this by completing tasks which will be presented to you.

Please know that in this evaluation we are testing the interface, not you. If you are having trouble navigating the interface, then that is not a problem with your understanding. It is a problem with our interface. If you get stuck and are not sure of how to proceed, please ask the evaluation coordinator present for help. If you would like to end the experiment at anytime, you are welcome to do so. 

For each task you are asked to complete, we ask that you do so quickly and accurately.

## Outline of the evaluation procedure

The evaluation will proceed as follows. The evaluation coordinator will be directing this process. 

1. If you have not yet filled in the sign up questionnaire, you will be given time to do so.
2. After finishing this section of the manual, you will be asked to complete a Mental Rotations Test (MRT).
3. You will then be asked to evaluate three different rotation controllers. The documentation for the controllers is  will also be shown to you before using that controller. For reference, you also have a hard copy of the all the experimental documentation. The evaluation consists of two stages:
    - First, you will be given 3 minutes of training time to familiarise yourself with the controller. 
    - After this, you will be given 12 tasks to complete as quickly and accurately as you can.
    - Finally, you will be asked to evaluate its usability through a questionnaire.

If you have any questions about this procedure, please don't hesitate to ask the evaluation coordinator.
