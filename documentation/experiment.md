# Evaluation Documentation

We would like to thank you for taking part in our evaluation. In this evaluation, you will be evaluating three different three dimensional user interfaces (3DUIs). These UIs are called "rotation controllers" as they allow you to rotate three dimensional shapes. You will be doing this by completing tasks which will be presented to you.

Please know that in this evaluation we are testing the interface, not you. If you are having trouble navigating the interface, then that is not a problem with your understanding. It is a problem with our interface. If you get stuck and are not sure of how to proceed, please ask the evaluation coordinator present for help. If you would like to end the experiment at anytime, you are welcome to do so. 

For each task you are asked to complete, please do so accurately and quickly.

## Outline of the evaluation procedure

The procedure of the evaluation is as follows. The evaluation coordinator will be directing this process. 

1. If you have not yet filled in the SRRA, you will be given time to do so.
2. After finishing this section of the manual, you will be asked to complete a Mental Rotations Test (MRT).
3. You will then be asked to complete some tasks using different rotation controllers. The documentation for the rotation controllers is presented in a booklet in front of you. It will also be shown before using that controller. The documentation for the types of tasks you will be asked to do is presented below.
4. Finally, you will be asked to fill in some questionnaires about those rotation controllers.
